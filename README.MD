The Go Template is a template/starter go project.

## Out of the box support for

- GraphQL
- Dockerization
- Authorization middleware
- Redis Cache
- Graphql Subscription
- Paginated endpoints
- Simplified support for migrations and seeders
- DAO layer for all database interactions

## Getting started

Using go-template requires having Go 1.7 or above. Once you download go-template (either using Git or go get) you need to configure the following:

1. Run the `pre-commit-setup.sh` script to install the pre-commit hooks locally.

2. Set the ("ENVIRONMENT_NAME") environment variable, either using terminal or os.Setenv("ENVIRONMENT_NAME","dev").

3. Install the sqlboiler, sql-migrate and gqlgen using
```
  go get -v github.com/rubenv/sql-migrate/... \
  github.com/volatiletech/sqlboiler \
  github.com/99designs/gqlgen
  ```

4. To run all the migrations using the script setup-local.sh as follows `./setup-local.sh`.

5. Generate the graphql models using `gqlgen generate`

6. Run the app using:

```bash
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

# Setting up database (postgres)

- Requirement [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  
Steps to set up database with ```username``` and ```role``` using terminal

  - Enter postgres terminal ```psql postgres```
  - Create new database ```CREATE DATABASE go_template;```
  - Create a new role with password ```CREATE ROLE go_template_role WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'go_template_role456';```

**NOTE:** Replace these credentials in ```.env``` file of the project

# Using Docker

To ease the development process a make file is provided

- **`make local`**  
  Requires `.env.local` file to be present and set  
  This starts the containers in `local` stage, bind the `current directory` to `/go/src/server` inside the `go-template_server_1` container and then starts the `terminal` inside `go-template_server_1`. Once the development is over, `exit` the terminal and call `make tear env=local` to stop all the containers

# Running migrations

Migrations are present in ```internal/migrations``` package. Run below command to run all migrations at once:
```
sql-migrate up -env postgres
```
To drop migration use following
```
sql-migrate down -env postgres -limit=0
```
To check status of migration use following
```
sql-migrate new -env postgres <name>
```
To add new migration use following, it creates a new empty migration template with pattern `<current time>-<name>.sql`
```
sql-migrate new -env postgres <name>
```
append query to above file

For more information on migration package refer [here](https://github.com/rubenv/sql-migrate)

```

# DB Models

generate your database models
```
sqlboiler psql --no-hooks
```

# graphQL

generate the graphql models from the database schema
```
gqlgen generate
```

## API (for graphQL to operate)

- Graphql endpoint ```POST``` request ```/graphql```

- Playground endpoint for schema ```/playground```

  Take a look at the following file

  - [pkg/api/api.go](pkg/api/api.go)
  
## Schema

- Schema can generated or altered manually

  Take a look at the following file

  - [schema.graphql](schema.graphql)
  
## Resolver

- Queries and mutation can be implemented as per convenience

  Take a look at the following file

  - [resolver.go](resolver.go)


## Infrastructure

### Create infrastructure

Application name should container only lowercase letters. No hyphens and underscores or any other special characters.

```
./scripts/setup-ecs.sh gotemplate dev
```

Make sure that the manifest.yml has http.path: '/'

```
http:
  # Requests to this path will be forwarded to your service.
  # To match all requests you can use the "/" path.
  path: '/'
  # You can specify a custom health check path. The default is "/".
  # healthcheck: '/'

```

### Update infrastructure

```
./scripts/update-ecs.sh gotemplate dev
```

## Testing

Get test coverage using
```
go test -cover
```

## Generate mocks

Sample command to generate mocks

```
  mockgen --build_flags=--mod=mod github.com/go-playground/validator  FieldError
```

## Postman Collection

The postman collection can be found [here](postman/collection.json) and has been auto-generated using [graphql-test](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-testkit)
