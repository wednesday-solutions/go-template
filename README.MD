The Go Template is a template/starter go project.

## Out of the box support for

- GraphQL
- Dockerization
- Authorization middleware
- Redis Cache
- Graphql Subscription
- Paginated endpoints
- Simplified support for migrations and seeders
- DAO layer for all database interactions

## Getting started

Using go-template requires having Go 1.7 or above. Once you download go-template (either using Git or go get) you need to configure the following:

1. Set the ("ENVIRONMENT_NAME") environment variable, either using terminal or os.Setenv("ENVIRONMENT_NAME","dev").

2. To run all the migrations using the script setup-local.sh as follows `./setup-local.sh`.

3. Generate the graphql models using `./generate-models.sh`

4. Run the app using:

```bash
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

# Setting up database (postgres)

- Requirement [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  
Steps to set up database with ```username``` and ```role``` using terminal

  - Enter postgres terminal ```psql postgres```
  - Create new database ```CREATE DATABASE go_template;```
  - Create a new role with password ```CREATE ROLE go_template_role WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'go_template_role456';```

**NOTE:** Replace these credentials in ```.env``` file of the project

# Using Docker

- Requirement [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

You can chose to use Docker-compose for `local`, `prod` and `test` stages. This would take care of all the dependencies, i.e., No need for locally having `Golang`, `PostgreSQL`, `redis` and other `cli` tools used in the template.

There will be 3 containers produced,

- **`go-template_db_1`** this container is based on `postgres:13` image and is referred as `db` when connecting from the `server` source code.  

- **`go-template_redis_1`** this container is based on `redis:6-alpine` image and is referred as `redis` when connecting from the `server` source code.  

- **`go-template_server_1`** this container is where your source code lives and is based on `golang:1.15.2-buster` image (in `local` and `test` stage) or `scratch` image (in `prod` stage).

Also, there will be 5 monitoring containers produced for Prometheus set-up

- **`go-template_prometheus_1`** this container is based on `prom/prometheus:v2.22.0` image and needs `PROMETHEUS_PORT` env variable to be set. When set correctly prometheus could be accessed at `http://<host-ip>:<PROMETHEUS_PORT>` and Prometheus expression browser would be running at `http://<host-ip>:<PROMETHEUS_PORT>/graph/`  

- **`go-template_cadvisor_1`** this container is based on `gcr.io/google_containers/cadvisor:v0.36.0` image and needs `PROMETHEUS_CADVISOR_PORT` env variable to be set. When set correctly cAdvisor could be accessed at `http://<host-ip>:<PROMETHEUS_CADVISOR_PORT>` and matrics for all the running containers (8) can be found at `http://<host-ip>:<PROMETHEUS_CADVISOR_PORT>/docker/`  

- **`go-template_grafana_1`** this container is based on `grafana/grafana:7.2.2` image and needs `GRAFANA_PORT`, `GRAFANA_USER`, `GRAFANA_PASS` and `PROMETHEUS_PORT` env variables to be set. When set correctly Grafana Dashboards could be accessed at `http://<host-ip>:<GRAFANA_PORT>`. It already has 3 pre-configured Dashboards (inspired by [stefanprodan/dockprom](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom)). It is recommended to use grafana for viewing/monitoring the matrixes  

- **`go-template_node-exporter_1`** this container is based on `prom/node-exporter:v1.0.1` image and needs `PROMETHEUS_NODE_EXPORTER_PORT` env variable to be set. When set correctly node-exporter could be accessed at `http://<host-ip>:<PROMETHEUS_NODE_EXPORTER_PORT>` and matrics for host machine can be found at `http://<host-ip>:<PROMETHEUS_NODE_EXPORTER_PORT>/metrics/`  

- **`go-template_alertmanager_1`** this container is based on `prom/alertmanager:v0.21.0` image and needs `PROMETHEUS_ALERTMANAGER_PORT` env variable to be set. When set correctly Prometheus Alert Manager could be accessed at `http://<host-ip>:<PROMETHEUS_ALERTMANAGER_PORT>`. Any alert created by Prometheus would be visible here, you can set custom alert receivers (like Slack alert) in `/alertmanager/config.yml`.

When in `local` stage there will be 2 more container,

- **`go-template_pgAdmin_1`** this container is based on `dpage/pgadmin4:4` and requires `PGADMIN_PORT`, `PGADMIN_EMAIL` and `PGADMIN_PASS` env variables to work. To connect to `go-template_db_1` from `pgadmin` put `db` as **Host name/ Address**

- **`go-template_redisinsight_1`** this container is based on `redislabs/redisinsight:1.7.1` and requires `REDIS_INSIGHT_PORT` env variables to work. To connect to `go-template_redis_1` from `redisinsight` put `redis` as **Host**

To ease the development process a make file is provided with 5 commands

- **`make local`**  
  Requires `.env.local` file to be present and set  
  This starts the containers in `local` stage, bind the `current directory` to `/go/src/server` inside the `go-template_server_1` container and then starts the `terminal` inside `go-template_server_1`. Once the development is over, `exit` the terminal and call `make tear env=local` to stop all the containers

- **`make test`**  
  Requires `.env.test` file to be present and set  
  This starts the containers in `test` stage and runs `go test -v ./...` inside `go-template_server_1` container. This can be used for `CI/CD` pipelines too. Remember to call `make tear env=test` to stop the containers.

- **`make prod`**  
  Requires `.env.prod` file to be present and set  
  This starts the containers in `prod` stage. You cannot connect to `go-template_server_1` because it has no terminal the contain is build from `scratch` image with only the `go binary` running in it. To stop the containers use `make tear env=prod` and to get live logs from the containers use `make logs env=prod`.

- **`make logs env=<stage>`**  
  this command gives the logs of all the containers in the given stage, useful because the containers are started in detached mode (`-d`)

- **`make tear env=<stage>`**  
  this command tears down (`docker-compose down`) all 3 running containers (`db`, `redis`, `server`).

# Running migrations

Migrations are present in ```internal/migrations``` package. Run below command to run all migrations at once:
```
sql-migrate up -env postgres
```
To drop migration use following
```
sql-migrate down -env postgres -limit=0
```
To check status of migration use following
```
sql-migrate new -env postgres <name>
```
To add new migration use following, it creates a new empty migration template with pattern `<current time>-<name>.sql`
```
sql-migrate new -env postgres <name>
```
append query to above file

For more information on migration package refer [here](https://github.com/rubenv/sql-migrate)
